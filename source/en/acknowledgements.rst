Data sources
============

The Marine InVEST development team would like to acknowledge the following
sources for data that are provided with the models:

**WAVEWATCH III** model hindcast reanalysis results are from NOAA's National
Weather Service

**ETOPO1** was developed by and is available from NOAA's National Geophysical
Data Center (NGDC). (Amante, C. and B. W. Eakins, ETOPO1 1 Arc-Minute Global Relief Model: Procedures, Data Sources and Analysis. NOAA Technical Memorandum NESDIS NGDC-24, 19 pp, March 2009).

**The Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Shoreline Database
(GSHHS)** is developed and maintained by Paul Wessel, SOEST, University of
Hawai'i, Honolulu, and Walter H.F. Smith, NOAA Geosciences Lab, National Ocean
Service, Silver Spring, MD. It can be accessed via NOAA's `National Geophysical
Data Center (NGDC) <https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/shorelines/gshhs.html>`_.

High-resolution Shoreline Database, J. Geophys. Res., 101)

**British Columbia Shorezone Data** are provided courtesy of the Province of
British Columbia, Ministry of Natural Resource Operations, GeoBC Division. The
data used for this model is a snapshot in time. For the most current coastal
resource and shorezone data please visit http://www.geobc.gov.bc.ca.

**Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada** provides commercial fishery data
layers (groundfish trawl and longline, salmon troll, and shrimp trawl)
collected from 1993-95 through interviews with fisheries officers for the West
Coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Data are publicly available
through `GeoBC <http://geobc.gov.bc.ca/>`_, the geographic information
clearinghouse for British Columbia Canada.
