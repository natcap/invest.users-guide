InVEST GLOBIO Model
===================

Summary
-------

The GLOBIO model provides an index of biodiversity according to mean
species abundance (MSA), the average population-level response across a
range of species, to different stressors, including land-use change,
fragmentation, and infrastructure. The model can be used as a static
assessment of how far below a pristine state the current environment is
or to estimate how a change in any of the stressors would lead to a
stress in biodiversity or ecosystem integrity, as indicated by MSA.

Introduction
------------

The GLOBIO methodology was developed by the United Nations Environmental
Programme (UNEP, Alkemade et al. 2009) to model human impacts on
biodiversity, measured by mean species abundance (MSA). Mean Species
Abundance is an improvement over the more traditional species-area curve
approach for two reasons. First, it gives aggregate estimates of species
densities, not just species presence, which is important to represent
true diversity since presence alone gives limited information about
population viability (Balmford et al 2012). Second, it relates more than
habitat area to changes in biodiversity by including information about
the impact of fragmentation and threats from infrastructure (and climate
change and nitrogen deposition if the full version of GLOBIO were
implemented).

The model
---------

The GLOBIO method consists of a set of equations linking environmental
drivers to biodiversity impact, tables of parameters to estimate the
above equations, based on a broad literature review, and suggested
methodologies for inputting and processing the spatial data required. We
have extended the GLOBIO methodology to downscale their global approach
to a landscape level.

How it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GLOBIO approach is based on mean species abundance (MSA, see
Schwartz et al. 2003 for an example usage of MSA). An MSA estimation
ranges from 0 to 1, indicating the average proportional change in
abundance of individual species in a location against that same location
being pristine vegetation. An MSA of 1.0 implies that on average,
species abundances are the same as in pristine land while an MSA of 0.0
implies that average species abundance is zero. Comparing MSA values of
different scenarios identifies how anthropogenic changes affect
biodiversity (e.g., changing from a scenario with a mean MSA of 0.6 to a
new scenario with 0.5 implies that, on average, individual species’
abundances declined 16.6% due to the land use change). In GLOBIO, an MSA
value is defined for every grid-cell within a geospatial extent.

Stressors decrease MSA in a multiplicative way. In the GLOBIO3 paper,
the stressors included land use/land cover (LU), excess atmospheric
nitrogen deposition (N), proximity of infrastructure (mainly roads; I),
fragmentation (F) and climate change (CC), as in the following equation
to calculate MSA per pixel (i):

.. math:: \text{MS}A_{i} = MSA_{LU_{i}} \bullet MSA_{N_{i}} \bullet MSA_{I_{i}} \bullet MSA_{F_{i}} \bullet MSA_{CC_{i}}

To consider changes in land-use, we ignore the nitrogen deposition term
and climate change terms; since neither of these terms change with each
land-change scenario, they will cancel out when percent change in total
(summed) MSA is calculated.

We refine the GLOBIO methodology for MSA change due to infrastructure,
fragmentation, and land-use in order to make use of higher resolution
land-use/land-cover data (500 m pixels from MODIS rather than 50 km
pixels used by UNEP) needed to detect finer-scale ecological response
that may include nonlinearities. Downscaling requires new methods for
assigning land management regime sub-classes with more precision based
on high-resolution data rather than continent-wide aggregates, and a
more sophisticated approach for quantifying fragmentation than applying
overall averages of patch size for different habitats.

Calculating MSA Impact from Infrastructure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Table 1 provides the data from Alkemade et al. (2009) for MSA values of
different buffers around infrastructure that impact different
ecosystems. The impact of infrastructure on MSA is determined solely by
distance, not by the nature of the intervening vegetation. An area of
cropland that is 5 km from a road will have its MSA reduced by a factor
of 0.9 regardless of whether the area between the cropland and the road
is tropical forest or more cropland. All sources of infrastructure are
aggregated into a “man-made” land use/land cover class. The remaining
land cover classes, which can then be considered vegetative or “natural”
are split into three basic types: tropical forest, temperate or boreal
forest, and grassland or cropland. The distance of these different
habitat classes from infrastructure is used to calculate the impact zone
for determining MSA from infrastructure, using Table 1.

Calculating MSA Impact from Fragmentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We augment the standard GLOBIO approach to fragmentation analysis by
using a fragmented forest quality index (FFQI). The FFQI is similar to
methods used in the forestry literature, and is calculated by
considering how many of a forest’s neighboring cells are also forested.
Rather than identifying the expected MSA impact from patch-size (as in
GLOBIO), the FFQI estimates the relative effect of fragmentation with a
Gaussian smoothing function. This treats habitat patches that are
separated by only very small patches of infrastructure or non-habitat as
less fragmented that habitat patches separated by wider distances. We
convert the FFQI values on our map to km\ :sup:`2` to match the zones
defined in Table 2 (according to Alkemade 2009) by taking the square
root of the area to convert it to the width/height of the patch.
Although the method is different from how UNEP defined patches,
comparisons to the literature showed FFQI to be an accurate
approximation of more cumbersome patch-based approach.

Calculating MSA Impact from Land Use Change
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The most difficult aspect of GLOBIO to implement is assigning different
land-use/land-cover categories that relate to intensity of management or
human use, since this information is often absent in remotely-sensed
global land-cover datasets. To assist with this classification, we
developed simple rules for reclassifying the MODIS or other satellite
land-use/land-cover maps into the management categories for which MSA is
quantified by GLOBIO’s broad literature reviews. Table 3 presents the
rule-based categorization used to convert MODIS data to
GLOBIO-compatible classes. LULC types that are mapped to more than one
GLOBIO type are then split according to other auxiliary datasets
described below.

Forests:
'''''''''

To distinguish between primary forest and other forest, including
secondary (replanted) forests or forests with some extractive use and
plantation forests, we analyze fragmentation in forest cover using FFQI
and assign different use categories based on FFQI, with primary forest
above a certain user-defined threshold. This approach assumes that
pristine forests are more likely to be found in large, unfragmented
tracts of forest, and that secondary or lightly used forests are more
likely to be found in the most highly fragmented patches of forest. The
threshold can be calibrated such that the aggregate amount of primary
and secondary or lightly-used forests match estimates at the national or
continental scale (documented in Alkemade et al. 2009).

Shrubland and Grassland:
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

To distinguish between primary vegetation (more pristine) grasslands,
grazed grasslands, and man-made pastures (deforested areas used for
pasture), we compare the potential vegetation map generated by
Ramankutty and Foley (1999) described above to actual vegetation
determined by MODIS land-cover data. If a particular pixel is designated
forest according to the potential vegetation map, but is listed as
grassland in MODIS, it has likely forest that has been cleared for
grazing, in this case the pixel is reclassified as “man-made pasture.”
If a pixel is grassland according to the potential vegetation map and is
listed as grassland in the MODIS data, a separate dataset is utilized,
quantifying the proportional pasture area at ~10 km resolution developed
by Ramankutty et al. (2008). This pixel is defined as “livestock
grazing” if the proportion of the grid-cell in pasture is greater than a
user-defined threshold. The threshold can be chosen such that aggregate
totals of livestock grazing match national and provincial data, as
described above for forests. If the grassland pixel is lower than the
grazing threshold, it will be defined as primary vegetation.

Cropland:
''''''''''

Because cropland intensification is only calculated in the
MSA\ :sub:`LU` and does not affect the configuration of primary habitat
and thus the fragmentation calculated for MSA\ :sub:`F`, the spatial
location of intensification is not necessary to define. The user only
needs to designate the proportion of agriculture in the landscape that
is intensified (i.e., not low-input agriculture). This can be found in
the regional datasets cited by Alkemade et al. (2009) or available
through FAO, or can be derived a dataset developed by Foley et al.
(2011) that maps yield gaps for all major commodity crops globally at
~10 km resolution. This methodology compares agricultural production in
similar climates (based on precipitation and growing degree days) and
rates crop yield in different regions according to the maximum yields
attained for its particular climate. The difference between actual and
maximum attainable yield is defined as the “yield gap.” The yield gap
can serve as a surrogate for (lack of) intensification, and the user can
examine the yield gap maps for their region of interest to determine
what proportion of the landscape falls below a certain level of yield
gap.

Limitations and simplifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MSA is an aggregate estimate, making it impossible to track
compositional effects, and there are many different compositional
possibilities for the same MSA. While MSA caps relative abundance of
individual species at 1, ensuring that a local rise in one species
cannot disguise a fall in overall species abundance, an MSA of 0.5 could
mean that all species are half as abundant as in a pristine state, or
that one species has suffered immense decline while the rest have
remained constant, or anywhere in between. Additional information about
the shape of the distribution of species abundances and extinction
probabilities related to different levels of MSA could improve the
usefulness of this index. But even then, diversity is more complex than
numbers of species and population numbers. Some conservation biologists
argue that species composition is as important as any other measure of
diversity, and tracking specific species is essential to estimating
impacts on threatened or endangered species or culturally valuable
species (Phalan et al. 2011 Food Policy). To achieve this level of
specificity, the impacts of different land-use strategies would need to
be evaluated for each species individually and then combined across
species for summary results, which may not be possible in many regions
of the world with low data availability and high agricultural and other
development pressure. In such cases, MSA provides a quick and easy to
use index for biodiversity change in decision contexts.

In our application of GLOBIO, we use the mean parameter values and their
standard errors to estimate the impacts of infrastructure, land-use, and
fragmentation at new locations, which assumes that these values
represent a random sample of species and geographic locations. However,
limited data availability for certain taxonomic groups and geographic
regions mean that there are potential biases in the parameter estimates
that add an unquantifiable degree of uncertainty to predictions based on
our application of GLOBIO.

The estimates of the impact of infrastructure are based on a
meta-analysis of ~75 studies, predominately of bird and mammal
populations in Europe and North America, with some information on
insects and plants (Alkemade et al. 2009; Benítez-López et al 2010).
Whether the impacts of infrastructure are similar for other taxonomic
groups or geographic areas is unknown.

Estimates of the impacts of land use are based on a slightly greater
number of studies, with 89 identified in the initial publication of
GLOBIO (Alkemade et al. 2009) and 195 identified in a final published
meta-analysis (de Baan et al. 2013). The parameter estimate for all
artificial surfaces/built-up areas was based on expert opinion,
representing densely populated cities, and without quantification of
uncertainty (Alkemade et al. 2009). Datasets come largely from tropical
regions, with fewer from temperate regions and none from boreal zones
(de Baan et al. 2013). Data were available for 9 out of 14 biomes, and
for many biomes, information was only available for some land use types.
For example, information on permanent crops, agroforestry and artificial
areas came only from two biomes. For three biomes, information was only
available for pastures, but not for other land use types. As is common,
data were also taxonomically biased towards vertebrate and plant species
(de Baan et al. 2013). Arthropods were under-represented, and bacteria
and fungi were not included at all in the database.

Furthermore, our assignment of satellite land-cover (e.g., forest or
grassland) to the different GLOBIO land-use classes (e.g., primary vs.
secondary forest or pristine vs. grazed grassland) introduce additional
error that is not incorporated into the analysis. While we can ensure
that our assignments aggregate up to national or regional level
statistics, we cannot ground-truth our classification system to quantify
the level of accuracy or uncertainty.

The impacts of fragmentation on mean species abundance (MSA) are based
on six datasets from 3 publications. The proportion of species with a
viable population was used as a proxy for MSA (Alkemade et al. 2009),
and it is unclear how much additional uncertainty in the parameters that
adds. Taxonomic and geographic biases are again a limitation. Two
studies focus exclusively on mammals, including ~30 mammal species in
Florida (Allen et al. 2001) and 10 species of carnivores from around the
world (Woodroffe & Ginsberg 1998). The third study is limited
exclusively to Europe, of which half of the 202 species included are
birds (Bouwma et al. 2002).

Data needs
----------

**NOTE: All spatial data must be projected in meters (i.e., a
local, not a global or lat-long projection), to ensure accurate distance
to infrastructure calculations. The model will not execute without a
defined projection.**

- :investspec:`globio msa_parameters_path` The example below (included in the sample data) may be used as-is. It gives the mean values and standard errors provided in Alkemade et al. (2009). Advanced users may with to alter this table to put high and low estimates from confidence intervals in the msa_x column, to aid in uncertainty assessment.

   Columns:

   - :investspec:`globio msa_parameters_path.columns.msa_type`
   - :investspec:`globio msa_parameters_path.columns.value`
   - :investspec:`globio msa_parameters_path.columns.msa_x`

   **Example:** This example contains two extra columns, *Measurement* and *SE*, which are not used by the model. *SE* is the standard error associated with each MSA value, according to the meta-analysis in Alkemade et al. (2009). These values are recorded here in this sample data set so that the user can adjust the MSA_x values according to the confidence interval. *Measurement* describes the metric by which the value in the subsequent column is measured.

- :investspec:`globio infrastructure_dir`

   .. note::
      Unlike other spatial inputs to InVEST, only specific file formats are supported in the infrastructure directory. Raster infrastructure files must be in GeoTIFF format ending in .tif. Vector infrastructure files must be in ESRI Shapefile format ending in .shp. In a future InVEST version, other file formats may be allowed.

- :investspec:`globio aoi_path`

- :investspec:`globio intensification_fraction` Used in the computation of MSA\ :sub:`LU`. The rest is considered to be low-input agriculture.

- :investspec:`globio predefined_globio`

There are two options for the LULC input:

  a. Vegetation-specific (not management-specific) land-cover. This is
      the type of land-cover you may acquire from MODIS or other
      remotely-sensed data sources. It distinguishes between forest,
      grassland, savanna, cropland, and other vegetation types. It does
      NOT distinguish between the differences in management defined by
      GLOBIO, such as primary vs. secondary vegetation, or grassland vs.
      pasture. If this option is chosen, several helper datasets (listed
      as required for option 1a, below) will be required.

   b. Management-specific land-cover, following the classification
      scheme established by GLOBIO (see Table 3, above). If this option
      is chosen, tick the box for “Predefined land use map for GLOBIO”
      and enter the map there. All other data inputs will turn grey
      except for the other required data set, the infrastructure
      directory, and the optional AOI input.

If you select the option to use predefined GLOBIO LULC, you only need to provide the GLOBIO LULC map:

- :investspec:`globio globio_lulc_path`

If you use a custom LULC map, you must provide several additional inputs:

- :investspec:`globio lulc_path`

- :investspec:`globio lulc_to_globio_table_path`

  Columns:

  - :investspec:`globio lulc_to_globio_table_path.columns.lucode`
  - :investspec:`globio lulc_to_globio_table_path.columns.globio_lucode`

  *Example*: On the left is MODIS land-cover data, using the UMD classification, as defined in Table 3. On the right is the GLOBIO land-cover translation, which lumps the forest classes (1-5 in MODIS) into 130, grassland/shrubland (6-10 in MODIS) into 131, and agriculture (12 in MODIS) into 132. Urban land-use (13 in MODIS) maps directly onto built-up lands (10 in GLOBIO). Barren or sparsely vegetated (16 in MODIS) can be treated primary vegetation (1 in GLOBIO). The subsequent datasets and/or user inputs will help determine how to split up the 130, 131, and 132 into primary and secondary vegetation, rangelands and pasture, and intensified and unintensified agriculture, respectively.

- **msa_i_<suffix>.tif**: A raster of MSA calculated for impacts of
      infrastructure only.

Intermediate Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **distance_to_infrastructure_<suffix>.tif**: A map coding each pixel by
      its distance to the nearest infrastructure, used to compute
      MSA\ I. Distance in this raster is measured as number of pixels,
      which is converted to meters in the model using the defined
      projection.

- **globio_lulc_<suffix>.tif**: The final land use map converted to
      GLOBIO classification, as outlined in Table 3. If desired, this
      map (or any altered version of this map) could be used to run the
      model using option 1b, above. This is used to compute MSA\ LU.

- **primary_veg_smooth_<suffix>.tif**: A Gaussian-filtered (“smoothed”)
      map of primary vegetation (identified in globio_lulc), used to
      compute MSA\ F.

- **tmp/ffqi_<suffix>.tif**: A map of the forest fragmentation quality
      index (ffqi), used to differentiate between primary and secondary
      forest in the GLOBIO land use classification.

- **tmp/combined_infrastructure_<suffix>.tif**: A map joining all the
      infrastructure files in the infrastructure directory (input 2
      above). If there is only one file in that directory, it should be
      identical to that file.

- **tmp/**: Other files in this directory represent intermediate steps in
      calculations of the final data in the output folder.

- **\_taskgraph_working_dir:** This directory stores metadata used
      internally to enable avoided re-computation.
