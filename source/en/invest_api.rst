InVEST Scripting Guide and API
******************************

Introduction
============

While there is a user interface for all the InVEST models, we also provide a python application programming interface (API) for more advanced usage of the models.  Full documentation for the ``natcap.invest`` python package is available here: https://invest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Additionally, our core geoprocessing routines have been open sourced as a separate python package, ``pygeoprocessing``, available here: https://github.com/natcap/pygeoprocessing. API documentation for PyGeoprocessing is available here: https://pygeoprocessing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

This documentation will be updated in more detail in the future.  Programming support is also available on our user forums: https://community.naturalcapitalalliance.org/.
