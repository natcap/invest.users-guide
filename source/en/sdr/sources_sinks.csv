Gully erosion (connected to the stream),"If the gully is connected to the stream, it is essentially a small stream tributary and its contribution may therefore be considered as streambank erosion.","The optional drainage layer can be used to represent this direct connection of the gully to the stream. To obtain the total sediment export, gully contribution (known from other studies) is added to the subwatershed level output."
Gully erosion (disconnected from the stream),"If the gully is disconnected, eroded soil is deposited on land and may eventually reach the stream together with rill-inter-rill sediment.","The additional soil loss can be added in post-processing. If a map of gullies and their estimated contribution is available (e.g. Vigiak 2011, Wilkinson 2014), it may be used with the SDR layer to compute the sediment export."
Streambank erosion,"Bank erosion is a function of soil erodibility and shear stress, i.e. the hydraulic forces applied to the channel. Detailed knowledge the bank height, and soil resistance to friction are necessary to inform a simple process-based model of these process.","The additional soil loss can be added in post-processing. If local information is available on the magnitude of streambank erosion (e.g. per unit length of stream), users can compute this values for each subwatershed based on the stream layer generated by the model, and then add the value to the InVEST sediment export values."
Landslides,Landslides occur in areas of high rainfall intensity and unstable slopes.,The additional soil loss can be analyzed using landslide-specific models and methods outside of InVEST.
Instream deposition,Larger particles tend to be deposited in the stream before reaching the catchment outlet,"A simple method based on the Rouse number is proposed by Pelletier (2012), which relates deposition probability to the channel slope and settling velocity."
