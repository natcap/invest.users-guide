*********************************
Urban Flood Risk Mitigation model
*********************************

Introduction
============

Flood hazard comes from different sources, including: riverine (or fluvial) flooding, coastal flooding, and stormwater (or urban) flooding - the focus of this InVEST model. Natural infrastructure can play a role for each of these flood hazards. Related to stormwater flooding, natural infrastructure operates mainly by reducing runoff production, slowing surface flows, and creating space for water (in floodplains or basins).

The InVEST model calculates the runoff reduction, i.e. the amount of runoff retained per pixel compared to the storm volume. For each watershed, it also calculates the potential economic damage by overlaying information on flood extent potential and built infrastructure.

The model
=========

How it works
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Runoff production and runoff attenuation index
----------------------------------------------

For each pixel :math:`i`, defined by a land use type and soil characteristics, we estimate runoff :math:`Q` (mm) with the Curve Number method:

.. math:: Q_{p,i} = \begin{Bmatrix}
        \frac{(P - \lambda S_{max_i})^2}{P + (1-\lambda) S_{max,i}} & if & P > \lambda \cdot S_{max,i} \\
        0 & & otherwise
        \end{Bmatrix}
    :label: runoff

Where :math:`P` is the design storm depth in mm, :math:`S_{max,i}` is the potential retention in mm, and :math:`\lambda \cdot S_{max}` is the rainfall depth needed to initiate runoff, also called the initial abstraction (:math:`\lambda=0.2` for simplification).

:math:`S_{max}` (calculated in mm) is a function of the curve number, :math:`CN`, an empirical parameter that depends on land use and soil characteristics (NRCS 2004):

.. math:: S_{max,i}=\frac{25400}{CN_i}-254
    :label:

The model then calculates runoff retention per pixel :math:`R_i` as:

.. math:: R_i=1-\frac{Q_{p,i}}{P}
    :label: runoff_retention

And runoff retention volume per pixel :math:`R\_m3_i` as:

.. math:: R\_m3_i=R_i\cdot P\cdot pixel.area\cdot 10^{-3}
    :label: runoff_retention_volume

With :math:`pixel.area` in :math:`m^2`.

Runoff volume (also referred to as "flood volume") per pixel :math:`Q\_m3_i` is also calculated as:

.. math:: Q\_m3_i=Q_{p,i}\cdot pixel.area\cdot 10^{-3}
   :label: flood_volume

Calculate potential service (optional)
--------------------------------------

First, :math:`\text{Affected.build}`, the sum of potential damage in $ to built infrastructure, is calculated for each watershed or sewershed :math:`W`:

.. math:: \text{Affected.build}_W = \sum_{b ∈ B}a(b,W)·d(b)
   :label: affected.build

where

* :math:`b` is a building footprint in the set of all built infrastructure :math:`B`
* :math:`a(b,W)` is the area in :math:`m^2` of the building footprint :math:`b` that intersects watershed :math:`W`
* :math:`d(b)` is the damage value in :math:`currency/m^2` (from the Damage Loss Table) for building :math:`b`'s type

We then calculate :math:`\text{Service.built}`, an indicator of avoided damage to built infrastructure, for each watershed :math:`W`:

.. math:: \text{Service.built}_W=\text{Affected.build}_W·\sum_{i ∈ W}R\_m3_i
   :label: service.built

where

* :math:`i` is a pixel in watershed :math:`W`
* :math:`R\_m3_i` is the runoff retention volume on pixel :math:`i`

:math:`\text{Service.built}` is expressed in :math:`currency·m^3`. It should be considered only an indicator, not an actual measure of savings.

Limitations and simplifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Runoff production:** the model uses a simple approach (SCS-Curve Number), which introduces high uncertainties. However, the ranking between different land uses is generally well captured by such an approach, i.e. that the effect of natural infrastructure will be qualitatively represented in the model outputs. Future work will aim to include a routing over the landscape: ideas include TOPMODEL (there is an R package), UFORE (used in iTree), CADDIES, etc

**Valuation approaches:** Currently, a simple approach to value flood risk retention is implemented, valuing flood risk as the avoided damage for built infrastructure. Alternative approaches (e.g. related to mortality, morbidity, or economic disruption) could be implemented. Another service metric is the affected population, i.e. the number of people at risk from flooding. This could focus on vulnerable groups only, e.g. related to age, language, etc. See Arkema et al., 2017, for a review of social vulnerability metrics. This metric can be calculated by summing the population in the intersection of the watershed and the flood-prone area.

Data Needs
==========

.. note:: Spatial layers for Urban Flood Mitigation may have different coordinate systems, but *they must all be projected coordinate systems*, not geographic.

.. note:: Raster inputs may have different cell sizes, and they will be resampled to match the cell size of the land use/land cover raster. Therefore, raster model results will have the same cell size as the land use/land cover raster.

- :investspec:`urban_flood_risk_mitigation workspace_dir`

- :investspec:`urban_flood_risk_mitigation results_suffix`

- :investspec:`urban_flood_risk_mitigation aoi_watersheds_path` These may be watershed or sewershed boundaries.

- :investspec:`urban_flood_risk_mitigation rainfall_depth` This is :math:`P` in equation :eq:`runoff`.

All LULC classes in the Land Cover raster MUST have corresponding values in this table. Each row is a land use/land cover class and columns must be named and defined as follows:

  Columns:

Interpreting Outputs
====================

 * **Parameter log**: Each time the model is run, a text (.txt) file will be created in the Workspace. The file will list the parameter values and output messages for that run and will be named according to the service, the date and time. When contacting NatCap about errors in a model run, please include the parameter log.

 * **Runoff_retention.tif**: raster with runoff retention values (no unit, relative to precipitation volume). Calculated from equation :eq:`runoff_retention`.

 * **Runoff_retention_m3.tif**: raster with runoff retention values (in :math:`m^3`). Calculated from equation :eq:`runoff_retention_volume`.

 * **Q_mm.tif**: raster with runoff values (mm). Calculated from equation :eq:`runoff`.

 * **flood_risk_service.shp**: Shapefile with results in the attribute table:

    * **rnf_rt_idx**: average of runoff retention values (:math:`R_i`) per watershed

    * **rnf_rt_m3**: sum of runoff retention volumes (:math:`R\_m3_i`), in :math:`m^3`, per watershed.

    * **flood_vol**: The flood volume (``Q_m3``, equation :eq:`flood_volume`) per watershed.

    * **aff_bld**: potential damage to built infrastructure in currency units, per watershed.  Only calculated when the Built Infrastructure Vector input is provided.

    * **serv_blt**: :math:`Service.built` values for this watershed (see equation :eq:`service.built`). An indicator of the runoff retention service for the watershed. Only calculated when the Built Infrastructure Vector input is provided.

Depth of Rainfall for Design Storm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A design storm is a hypothetical rainstorm used for modeling purposes. The design storm precipitation value should be chosen according to the area and goals. For instance, it could be the average precipitation per rain event, the precipitation at a certain percentile, or the maximum precipitation expected to occur once in 100 years.

To calculate the design storm, users can look up intensity-frequency-duration (IFD) tables available for their city. The storm duration is equal to the average time of concentration of the studied watersheds. Time of concentration can be derived from existing studies or from web tools: eg. https://www.lmnoeng.com/Hydrology/TimeConc.php. See Balbi et al. (2017) for a detailed description of these methods.
