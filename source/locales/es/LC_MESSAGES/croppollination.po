"The InVEST pollination model focuses on wild bees as a key animal "
"pollinator. It uses estimates of the availability of nest sites and "
"floral resources within bee flight ranges to derive an index of the "
"abundance of bees nesting on each cell on a landscape (i.e., pollinator "
"supply). It then uses floral resources, and bee foraging activity and "
"flight range information to estimate an index of the abundance of bees "
"visiting each cell. If desired, the model then calculates a simple index "
"of the contribution of these bees to agricultural production, based on "
"bee abundance and crop dependence on pollination. The results can be used"
" to understand changes in crop pollination and crop yield with changes in"
" land use and agricultural management practices. Required inputs include "
"a land use/land cover (LULC) map, land cover attributes, guilds or "
"species of pollinators present, and their flight ranges. To estimate wild"
" pollinator contributions to crop production requires information on "
"farms of interest, the crops grown there, and the abundance of managed "
"pollinators. The model's limitations include not accounting for "
"pollinator persistence over time or the effects of land parcel size."

"Crop pollination by bees and other animals is a potentially valuable "
"ecosystem service in many landscapes of mixed agricultural and natural "
"habitats (Allen-Wardell et al. 1998, Free 1993). Pollination can increase"
" the yield, quality, and stability of fruit and seed crops as diverse as "
"tomato, canola, watermelon, coffee, sunflower, almond, and cacao. Indeed,"
" Klein et al. (2007) found that 87 of 115 globally important crops "
"benefit from animal pollination, a service valued variously in the "
"billions to tens of billions per year globally (Costanza et al. 1997, "
"Losey and Vaughan 2006, Nabhan and Buchmann 1997, Southwick and Southwick"
" 1992)."

"Despite these numbers, it is important to realize that not all crops need"
" animal pollination. Some crop plants are wind pollinated (e.g., staple "
"grains such as rice, corn, wheat) or self pollinated (e.g., lentils and "
"other beans), needing no animal pollinators to successfully produce "
"fruits or seeds. Klein et al. (2007) provides a list of crops and their "
"pollination requirements that can help identify whether crops in a region"
" of interest may benefit from wild animal pollinators."

"Decision-makers can use information on crop pollinators, their abundance "
"across a landscape, and the pollination services they provide to crops in"
" several ways. First, with maps of pollinator abundance and crops that "
"need them, land use planners could predict consequences of different "
"policies on pollination services and income to farmers (for an example, "
"see Priess et al. 2007). Second, farmers could use these maps to locate "
"crops intelligently, given their pollination requirements and predictions"
" of pollinator availability. Third, conservation organizations or land "
"trusts could use the tool to optimize conservation investments that "
"benefit both biodiversity and farmers. Finally, governments or others "
"proposing payment schemes for ecosystem services could use the results to"
" estimate who should pay whom, and how much."

"A wide range of animals can be important pollinators (e.g., birds, bats, "
"moths and flies), but bees are the most important group for most crops "
"(Free 1993). As a result, the InVEST Pollination model focuses on the "
"resource needs and flight behaviors of wild bees. Many people think of "
"honeybees, managed in artificial hives, when they think of pollinators, "
"but wild bees also contribute to crop pollination. In fact, for several "
"important crops (e.g., blueberries), native species are more efficient "
"and effective pollinators than honeybees (Cane 1997). These native bees, "
"in addition to feral honeybees living in the wild, can benefit crops "
"without active management of captive hives. This is the pollination "
"service associated with habitat conservation."

"This model is adapted from Lonsdorf et al. (2009). For bees to persist on"
" a landscape, they need two things: suitable places to nest, and "
"sufficient food (provided by flowers) near their nesting sites. If "
"provided these resources, pollinators are available to fly to nearby "
"crops and pollinate them as they collect nectar and pollen. The model "
"translates land cover into an index of suitability (0-1) for bees to "
"create a pollinator source map. Higher scores indicate sources of greater"
" relative bee abundance. To calculate the index, the model assumes that "
"bees require two types of limiting resources to persist on a landscape - "
"nesting substrates and floral resources. Given an input of land cover "
"that describes the landscape, various suitability values of each LULC "
"class are assigned based on their ability to provide these resources."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/croppollination.rst:28
msgid ""
"The Pollination model then uses the nest supply index to estimate the "
"pollinators visiting crop fields. It assumes the supply from nearby "
"parcels contributes more than those farther away. We use insights from "
"Olsson et al. (2015) and weight bee visitation by the floral quality of "
"the parcel to reflect the central place foraging behavior that bees are "
"known to follow. In other words, the visitation rates to two parcels "
"equally distant from a nest are proportional to the floral qualities of "
"the parcels."

"Additionally, this model incorporates the potential use of managed bees "
"into a yield index. With information on the location of crops and their "
"dependence on pollinators, the model uses a simple yield function to "
"project how wild pollinator abundance in agricultural areas and the use "
"of managed bees contributes to an index of crop yields. The inclusion of "
"managed bees reflects guidance from recent work by the USDA-Funded "
"Integrated Crop Pollination Project (icpbees.org) to integrate the "
"combined benefits of managed and wild bees."
