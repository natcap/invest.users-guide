"Recreation and tourism are important components of many national and "
"local economies and they contribute in innumerable ways to quality of "
"life, sense of place, social connection, physical wellbeing, learning, "
"and other intangibles.  A key reason for studying patterns of recreation "
"or tourism is the economic significance of this industry.  The total "
"contribution of travel and tourism to the world's gross domestic product "
"(GDP) in 2011 was approximately $6 B USD (9% of GDP), with expected "
"growth to $10 B USD by 2022 (World Travel and Tourism Council 2012).  Of "
"course, economic impacts are only one way of measuring the importance of "
"recreation and tourism.  These activities are critical contributors to "
"diverse aspects of human wellbeing (Russell et al. 2013).  For example, "
"outdoor recreation is a spiritual experience for many people (eg Trainor "
"and Norgaard 1999), and social interactions in nature contribute to "
"building a sense of place (e.g. Willox et al. 2012)."

"A major and growing portion of recreation is \"nature-based\", involving "
"interactions with or appreciation of the natural environment (Balmford et"
" al. 2009).  For these types of activities, characteristics of the "
"environment influence people's decisions about where, when, and how to "
"recreate.  SCUBA divers, for example, select destinations based on the "
"water clarity, water temperature, and diversity of marine life (Williams "
"and Polunin 2000, Uyarra et al. 2009).  Bird-watchers are drawn to the "
"best places to see target species (Naidoo and Adamowicz 2005), which "
"inevitably are places where natural systems support populations of "
"desirable birds (Puhakka et al. 2011).  Some recreation depends on "
"environmental attributes such as species richness (Loureiro et al. 2012),"
" the diversity of habitats (Neuvonen et al. 2010, Loureiro et al. 2012), "
"precipitation (Loomis and Richardson 2006), and temperature (Richardson "
"and Loomis 2005), as well as to other attributes such as infrastructure "
"and cultural attractions (Mills and Westover 1987, Hill and Courtney "
"2006)."

"The purpose of the InVEST recreation model is to predict the spread of "
"person-days of recreation and tourism, based on the locations of natural "
"habitats, accessibility, and built features that factor into people's "
"decisions about where to recreate (Adamowicz et al. 2011).  The tool "

msgid ""
"The model displays rate of visitation across landscapes (grid cells) or "
"in discrete areas (polygons) and optionally builds a regression model to "
"estimate the contribution of attributes of the landscape to the "
"visitation rate, using a simple linear regression:"

"where :math:`x_{ip}` is the coverage of each attribute in each cell or "
"polygon (hereafter called 'cell'), :math:`i`, within an Area of Interest "
"(AOI) containing :math:`n` cells.  In the absence of empirical data on "
"visitation for :math:`y_i`, we parameterize the model using a "
"crowdsourced measure of visitation: geotagged photographs posted to the "
"website flickr (see :ref:`rec-photos` section for more information).  "
"Stated again, the InVEST recreation model predicts the spread of person-"
"days of recreation in space.  It does this using attributes of places, "
"such as natural features (eg habitat distributions), built features (eg "
"roads), and human uses (eg industrial activities), among others."

"The tool begins by log-transforming all :math:`y_i` values, by taking the"
" natural log of average photo-user-days per cell + 1.  Then, a simple "
"linear regression is performed to estimate the effect of each attribute "
"on log-transformed visitation rates across all grid cells within the "
"study region.  These estimates (the :math:`\\beta_{p}` values) can be "
"used for an additional scenario, to predict how future changes to the "
"landscape will alter visitation rate.  The model uses ordinary least "
"squares regression, performed by the linalg.lstsq function in python's "
"numpy library (van der Walt et al. 2011)."

msgid "Photo User Days"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/recreation.rst:52
msgid ""
"Since fine-scale data on numbers of visitors is often only collected at a"
" few specific locations in any study region, we assume that current "
"visitation can be approximated by the total number of annual person-days "
"of photographs uploaded to the photo-sharing website `flickr "
"<https://www.flickr.com>`_.  Many of the photographs in flickr have been "
"assigned to a specific latitude/longitude.  Using this location, along "
"with the photographer's user-name and date that the image was taken, the "
"InVEST model counts the total photo-user-days for each grid cell or "
"polygon. One photo-user-day at a location is one unique photographer who "
"took at least one photo on a specific day. For each cell, the model sums "
"the number of photo-user-days for all days from 2005-2014 (or a user-"
"defined range within those years), and returns the average annual number "
"of photo-user-days (PUD_YR_AVG). PUD_YR_AVG is :math:`y_i` in the "
"equation above."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/recreation.rst:54
msgid ""
"We have observed that the number of recreators who visit a location "
"annually is related to the number of photographs taken in the same area "
"and uploaded to the flickr database at 836 visitor attractions worldwide "
"(Wood et al. 2013).  The density of photographs varies spatially, and "
"this has ramifications for the cell-size that can be chosen for analysis "

"In the regression equation above, photo-user-days are the :math:`y_i` "
"variable and all the :math:`x` variables on the right side are predictor "
"variables. These are features in the Area of Interest that are likely to "
"influence the visitation patterns across space. Users may provide any "
"number of predictor variables and the model will compute a regression "
"that estimates :math:`\\beta_{p}` values for each predictor. "
":math:`\\beta_{p}` indicates the relationship between a predictor "
"variable and the visitation rate, after accounting for all other "
"predictor variables included in the regression."

"We find that it often helps to consider at least one predictor variable "
"from several main categories: natural capital (eg habitats, lakes), built"
" capital (eg roads, hotels), industrial activities, and access or cost "
"(eg distance to major airport).  Often, single variables representing "
"each of these categories can explain the majority of variation in photo-"

"If a regression is computed, the model can optionally estimate visitation"

"features that were selected as Predictor Variables, but may represent "
"modified versions of those features (e.g. modified road networks, "
"additional hotel points, altered habitat distributions, etc). Scenario "
"predictions are made using the regression equation above. First, "
"coefficients for each predictor variable are estimated as described in "
":ref:`rec-how-it-works`, then those coefficients are applied to the "
"values of each predictor that has been modified for a scenario. See :ref"

"The model does not presuppose that any predictor variable has an effect "
"on visitation.  Instead, the tool estimates the magnitude of each "
"predictor's effect based on its spatial correspondence with current "
"visitation in the area of interest.  The values of photo-person-days per "
"cells are taken as a measure of visitation and are regressed against the "
"values of the predictor variables across all cells.  When a Scenario "
"Predictor Table is provided, the tool uses the :math:`\\beta_{p}` values "
"computed for the Predictor Table, and applies them to the future scenario"
" predictors.  This step requires the assumption that people's responses "
"to attributes that serve as predictors in the model will not change over "
"time.  In other words, in the future, people will continue to be "
"attracted to, or repelled by, the predictors in the same way they are "
